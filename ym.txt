let's go back to the admin part and in There are 
1. manage_categories.php 

in there, I want to edit something 
A. place the existing categories in tabular form that includes edit, delete, and set package buttons
 When clicking on the set package button It will lead you to the form that consists of Pakacge name, Level(silver, gold, platinum), assign to the manager, date (starting and end date), description, price  
2. let's combine the manage manager and user pages into a single page and let's call it manage_users(it consists of manager and user) it must be placed into a tabular form that has an edit and delete button for each
3. feedback 
make it in tabular form

For Manager 
1. Events 
it must fetch from the database(that is assigned to his/her only) and place them into tabular form 
2. Report
Make a form to fill out about the event that it makes a report about it
3. calendar
show the real calendar and show when the events that happen on that data on the calendar

For user

1. Package
display categories that will have a photo for each 
2. set package 
in this part, the user creates a package(like admin did but it will not assign to manager it is only a job for the admin) for themselves and requests to admin
on the bottom, it will display the progression of the requested package (like pending, approved)
